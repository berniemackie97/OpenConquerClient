# WORLD-014: Authenticated map presentation

The world-entry snapshot supplies the map-data ID and the hero's initial tile position.
After admission, the client loads the matching map, its puzzle resources, and its terrain
scene resources from the configured content root. The role-creation screen transfers its
connection to the application and closes without disposing the transferred game session.

The world scene projects the hero tile through the existing camera and draws the map's
positioned puzzle records, ground puzzle, and terrain objects in component insertion order.
Each puzzle bitmap advances its own frame clock using
`ini/info.ini` `[PuzzleBmp] FrameIntervalMilliSec`, defaulting to 1000 milliseconds.
Terrain objects use their authored frame intervals.

Image decoding and texture uploads happen before `OpenGLRenderer.BeginFrame`.
The texture cache is tracked by the existing graphics-context owner; the decoded map and
scene state are not OpenGL resources and survive context recreation. After admission, login
and role input are no longer dispatched to their inactive screens.

## Remaining work

The default distributed content set is limited to startup and UI requirements. The
world-map assets are not committed to the repository. The content importer accepts an
explicit map-data ID and derives the required map, puzzle, terrain-scene, animation index,
and frame dependencies from the same loaders used by the client. The default import and
verification commands remain unchanged and continue to match the committed set.

To generate a local content set for Newbie Village, from the client repository root:

```bash
SOURCE="/Volumes/EnderChest/Development/Repos/GameDev/Conquer/client-5517/00_clean/clean/5517"
DEST="/tmp/openconquer-world-1010"

dotnet run --project tools/OpenConquer.Content.Tool -c Release -- \
  validate-map-puzzles --source "$SOURCE" --map-data-id 1010
dotnet run --project tools/OpenConquer.Content.Tool -c Release -- \
  validate-map-terrain-scenes --source "$SOURCE" --map-data-id 1010
dotnet run --project tools/OpenConquer.Content.Tool -c Release -- \
  import-client-content --source "$SOURCE" --destination "$DEST" --map-data-id 1010
dotnet run --project tools/OpenConquer.Content.Tool -c Release -- \
  verify-content-set --content-set "$DEST" --map-data-id 1010
dotnet run --project src/OpenConquer.Client -c Release -- \
  --content-root "$DEST/payload"
```

The importer requires a new destination directory and publishes it only after a complete
import. Delete or choose another destination before repeating the command. The generated
content set stays local; do not commit third-party assets to the public repository.
The server must be running for an authenticated-world smoke test. CI validates the importer
with small generated frame resources and the verified map data fixtures; it does not replace
a live OpenGL smoke test.

Type-4 animated scenery, the local hero, HUD, ongoing world packets, movement, and
remaining scenery kinds are not drawn yet. Those require a shared world-entity depth
ordering pass. The current frame is an authenticated map presentation, not a playable world.

## Verification

The world tests verify first-frame layer insertion order, the hero-centered projection,
and independent puzzle frame advancement. Content tests verify interval parsing and the
default. Validate the source assets with the map puzzle and terrain-scene content tools
before a local end-to-end smoke test.
