# OpenConquerStudio

One platform for runtime content, authoring, previews, and builds.
Supports client-content browsing, shared map previews, puzzle inspection, textures, sprite
atlases, and sprite animation. Map editing and characters remain in the [asset plan](asset-platform-plan.md).

## Run

Install the .NET SDK pinned in `global.json`. From this repository:

```sh
dotnet restore OpenConquerStudio.slnx --locked-mode
dotnet build OpenConquerStudio.slnx -c Release --no-restore
dotnet run --project src/OpenConquerStudio -c Release --no-build
```

Windows, macOS, and Linux are supported. The engine viewport requires desktop OpenGL
3.3 Core and GPU texture sharing. The **Pixels** tab inspects image data independently.

## Make or open a project

To work with **OpenConquerClient**, choose **Open client project** and select its repository
directory. Studio opens a persistent workspace under `.studio/authoring` and connects to
`content/retail-5517/payload`. The **Client content** tab browses actual maps, ANI catalogs,
images, and puzzle files. Select a map for the shared client-renderer preview; use the camera
tile controls to navigate. Select an ANI section or image, then **Import editable copy**.
Use **Client content folder** to attach an original installation instead. Source files remain
unchanged. Imported copies save and compile through the regular authoring workflow.

The automatically created `.studio/authoring` workspace is local and ignored by Git.
For a version-controlled game-asset project, use **New project** in your chosen content
directory, then **Client content folder** to attach the client sources.

1. **New project**: choose an existing empty directory. **Open project**: choose a directory containing `project.ocstudio`.
2. **Import texture**: select a supported TGA/DDS. **Client artwork** imports an editable copy from the included catalog.
   **New texture** creates a solid image without original game files.
3. Select a texture. Edit its name, flip, or rotation; click **Apply asset edits**.
   **Replace source image** preserves its identity and edit settings. Referencing atlases must still fit the result.
4. **Save** persists applied edits. **Undo** and **Redo** restore editing transactions within the current session.
5. **Save and build** creates and validates a new content directory beneath the folder you select.

Original import files stay unchanged. Apply/Rename buttons commit fields to the project;
unapplied typing is not saved. Closing or switching projects prompts for unsaved applied edits.
Only one Studio window or command-line operation can edit a project at a time.

To open a project at startup:

```sh
dotnet run --project src/OpenConquerStudio -c Release --no-build -- /path/to/project
```

Version 1 projects require an explicit migration copy. Close the source project first:

```sh
mkdir migrated-game
dotnet run --project tools/OpenConquerStudio.Tool -c Release --no-build -- migrate old-game migrated-game
```

## Author sprites and animation

1. Select a texture, then **New atlas**. The initial sprite covers the whole texture.
2. Select the atlas. Edit sprite rectangles and pixel pivots; **Apply sprite edits**.
   **Add sprite** adds another region. Remove unused regions with **Remove sprite**.
3. Select the atlas, then **New animation**. Its sprites become ordered frames.
4. Select the animation. Choose each frame's sprite and duration; **Update frame**.
   Add, remove, or reorder frames with the frame controls.
5. Set ticks per second and repeat mode; **Apply clip settings**. At 1000 ticks/second,
   100 ticks means 100 milliseconds. This is authored timing, independent of rendering rate.
6. Use **Play/Pause**, **Stop**, and the position slider in the engine viewport. Zoom adjusts the preview around the sprite pivot.
7. Save, reopen, and build. The dependency inspector shows resources used and resources affected by changes.
   Deleting a referenced resource is blocked; fix its dependents first.

## Use with OpenConquerClient or another game

Keep each game's Studio project in its own content directory. Builds contain `.octex`,
`.ocatlas`, `.ocanim`, and `content.json`. Do not load the editable project from a shipping game.

A .NET game references `src/OpenConquerStudio.Runtime/OpenConquerStudio.Runtime.csproj`.
Use `ContentPackage.Load(buildDirectory)` to validate and load the complete resource graph.
`package.Sprites.Sample(animationId, elapsedTicks)` returns the texture and sprite rectangle
at the clip's authored tick position. Upload texture pixels once using the existing
`OpenGLGraphicsDevice`, then draw through `OpenGLRenderer` with the returned rectangle and pivot.
Runtime loading has no Studio GUI or Conquer importer dependency.

OpenConquerClient already shares image decoding and rendering with Studio. It **does not yet
redirect its game resources to compiled Studio assets**. Importing artwork does not change
client layouts, states, maps, or installed files. Client adoption needs explicit resource bindings
and the existing authenticated content-release pipeline. Another game can consume the runtime
resources directly without any Conquer assets.

## Automation and checks

```sh
dotnet run --project tools/OpenConquerStudio.Tool -c Release --no-build -- build my-game compiled-content
dotnet run --project tools/OpenConquerStudio.Tool -c Release --no-build -- verify compiled-content
dotnet test OpenConquerStudio.slnx -c Release --no-build --no-restore
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/development -p test_studio_cli.py
```

Run the tool without arguments for all commands. Close the project in Studio before editing
it from the tool. Build destinations must be new; in-project builds belong under `Builds/`.
Hashes check integrity, not publisher authenticity. Signing and publishing remain future work.
